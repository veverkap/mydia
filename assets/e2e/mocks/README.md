# E2E Mock Services

This directory contains mock HTTP servers for external services.

## Purpose

Mock services provide predictable, fast responses from external dependencies:

- Prowlarr API mock
- qBittorrent/Transmission download client mocks
- OIDC provider mock
- Media metadata service mocks

## Implementation

Mock servers should be implemented as lightweight HTTP servers that can be started/stopped during tests:

```typescript
// prowlarr-mock.ts
import express from "express";

export function createProwlarrMock(port = 9696) {
  const app = express();

  app.get("/api/v1/indexer", (req, res) => {
    res.json([
      /* mock indexers */
    ]);
  });

  return app.listen(port);
}
```
