defmodule Mydia.Jobs.DownloadMonitor do
  @moduledoc """
  Background job for monitoring downloads and handling completion.

  With download clients as the source of truth, this job now focuses on:
  - Detecting completed downloads in clients
  - Marking downloads as completed in the database
  - Triggering media import jobs for completed downloads
  - Recording errors for failed downloads
  - Cleaning up downloads that were removed from clients

  ## Missing Download Detection

  When a download is manually removed from a download client (e.g., Transmission),
  the job will detect this and automatically remove the download record from the
  database. This ensures media items don't remain stuck with "downloading" status.
